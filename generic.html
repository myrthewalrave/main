								<p>I am currently studying at the university of Twente, before that I attended the highschool Porteum in Lelystad.</br>
								Porteum is at this moment the biggest highschool in the Netherlands and i enjoyed my time there.
								I started with Technasium, that is a project based subject that is given in some schools. I learned the basics of programming and designing there.
								In my third year I first took a few subjects in the year above me, but later I entirely skipped ahead.
								I had the subject package called NT, which is the most technical package you could choose.</br>
								In 2025 I graduated and made my choice to attend the university of Twente.
							</p>
								<p>I have quite a lot of interest, but I will collaberate on my biggest ones.</br>
								</p>
								<h3>
									Music
								</h3>
								<p>
									I've always had a passion for music and I still do.
									My first real experience with playing music were violin lessons, I started when I was around nine.
									When I was fourteen years old I stopped with violin lessons and I wanted to something else.
									On my fourtheenth birthday I got a Guitar for my birthday. It was just a basic and pretty cheap one, but it was enough.
									I started playing very often and I tought myself different songs. 
									A year after I stopped violin lessons I started with singing lessons, which I had for two years.
									We also had a keyboard at home, I had bought a ukelele and a harmonica, which I all started to learn.
									For as of right now I have had a couple performances, a few were at school or my music school, while others were at church or other places.
									I still really enjoy playing and writing music and I hope that music could be incorporated in my future job.
