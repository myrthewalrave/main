								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Myrthe.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>I am currently studying at the university of Twente, before that I attended the highschool Porteum in Lelystad.</br>
								Porteum is at this moment the biggest highschool in the Netherlands and i enjoyed my time there.
								I started with Technasium, that is a project based subject that is given in some schools. I learned the basics of programming and designing there.
								In my third year I first took a few subjects in the year above me, but later I entirely skipped ahead.
								I had the subject package called NT, which is the most technical package you could choose.</br>
								In 2025 I graduated and made my choice to attend the university of Twente.
							</p>
								<p>I have quite a lot of interests, but I will collaberate on my biggest ones.</br>
								</p>
								<h3>
									Music
								</h3>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Music.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>
									I've always had a passion for music and I still do.
									My first real experience with playing music were violin lessons, I started when I was around nine.
									When I was fourteen years old I stopped with violin lessons and I wanted to something else.
									On my fourtheenth birthday I got a guitar for my birthday. It was just a basic and pretty cheap one, but it was enough.
									I started playing very often and I tought myself different songs. 
									A year after I stopped violin lessons, I started with singing lessons, which I had for two years.
									We also had a keyboard at home, I had bought a ukelele and a harmonica, which I all started to learn.
									For as of right now I have done a couple performances, a few were at school or my music school, while others were at church or other places.
									I still really enjoy playing and writing music and I hope that music could be incorporated in my future job.
								</p>
								<h3>
									IT/Programming
								</h3>
								<p>
									Making things has always been a hobby of mine. When I was young I actually wanted to be an inventor and I kept a little notepad with me for my ideas.
									When I was at the BSO, which is a dutch name for after-school care for children aged 4-12, we sometimes had projects where we could make things related to tech.
									I can still remember two things that we made, one was a little light. 
									We got a kit where we got the components, it contained the light, a battery, a switch and of course the wires.
									we had to solder those together and make a base for it using a wood cutter.
									The other project was kind of the same, but instead of a light we made a speaker, which was a bit harder.
									Furthermore, in high school with Technasium, we could choose our one project.
									Me and my group wanted to make a game, so we designed the whole game in drawings and I tried to program it.
									Sadly I didn't nearly have enough time or resources, so I couldn't finish it, but I did learn the basics of programming there.
